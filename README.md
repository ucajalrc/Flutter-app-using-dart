# Measures Converter

A Flutter application developed for converting measurements between Metric and Imperial systems. This app allows users to input a value, select a starting unit (e.g., Meters, Kilograms), and convert it to a target unit (e.g., Feet, Pounds).

## Features

* **Unit Conversion**: Supports conversion for Distance (Meters, Kilometers, Feet, Miles) and Weight (Kilograms, Pounds).
* **Input Validation**: Ensures users enter valid numbers and prevents incompatible conversions (e.g., Weight to Distance).
* **User Interface**: Clean layout using Material Design components.
